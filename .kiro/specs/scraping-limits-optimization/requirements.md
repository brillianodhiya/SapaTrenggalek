# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current scraping system has hardcoded limits that restrict the amount of data collected from various sources, particularly Twitter/X. This limitation prevents comprehensive data collection and may cause important information to be missed. The system needs configurable scraping limits and optimized data collection strategies to ensure maximum coverage while respecting API rate limits.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable scraping limits so that I can adjust data collection volume based on API quotas and storage capacity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts scraping THEN it SHALL read scraping limits from environment variables or configuration files
2. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values that maximize data collection
3. WHEN scraping Twitter data THEN the system SHALL support collecting up to 100 tweets per search query (Twitter API maximum)
4. WHEN scraping user timelines THEN the system SHALL support collecting up to 100 tweets per user (Twitter API maximum)
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply new limits without requiring code changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want comprehensive data collection so that I can analyze trends and public sentiment accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping recent tweets THEN the system SHALL collect at least 100 tweets per scraping session
2. WHEN scraping user timelines THEN the system SHALL collect at least 50 tweets per official account
3. WHEN multiple scraping sources are available THEN the system SHALL collect data from all configured sources
4. IF API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL log the limitation and continue with other sources
5. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL report the actual number of items collected from each source

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want intelligent rate limit handling so that the scraping system can maximize data collection while respecting API constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. IF rate limits persist THEN the system SHALL continue with other data sources rather than failing completely
3. WHEN rate limits reset THEN the system SHALL automatically resume scraping from the limited source
4. WHEN scraping multiple accounts THEN the system SHALL distribute requests to avoid hitting rate limits
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative data sources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible scraping configuration so that I can easily adjust collection parameters for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific scraping limits
2. WHEN testing the system THEN the system SHALL support reduced limits to avoid exhausting API quotas
3. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL use optimized limits for maximum data collection
4. IF scraping fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging about limits and failures
5. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN the system SHALL expose metrics about scraping efficiency and limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the cron job to process all scraped data so that no collected information is lost due to processing limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cron job runs THEN it SHALL process all scraped data rather than limiting to 10 items
2. IF processing time approaches timeout limits THEN the system SHALL implement batch processing across multiple runs
3. WHEN large amounts of data are scraped THEN the system SHALL prioritize processing by urgency or recency
4. IF timeout occurs during processing THEN the system SHALL save progress and resume in the next run
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL report the actual number of items processed versus scraped
